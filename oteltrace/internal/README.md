# Internal
This internal module is used to define and document an internal only API for `oteltrace`.

These modules are not intended to be used outside of `oteltrace`.

The APIs found within `oteltrace.internal` are subject to breaking changes at any time
and do not follow the semver versioning scheme of the `oteltrace` package.
