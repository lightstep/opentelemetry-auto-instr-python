Basic Usage
===========

With ``oteltrace`` installed, the application can be instrumented.


Auto Instrumentation
--------------------

``oteltrace-run``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python applications can easily be instrumented with ``oteltrace`` by using the
included ``oteltrace-run`` command. Simply prefix your Python execution command
with ``oteltrace-run`` in order to auto-instrument the libraries in your
application.

For example, if the command to run your application is::

$ python app.py

then to auto-instrument using OpenTelemetry, the corresponding command is::

$ oteltrace-run python app.py

For more advanced usage of ``oteltrace-run``, like using an OpenTelemetry exporter, refer to the documentation :ref:`here<oteltracerun>`.

``patch_all``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To manually invoke the automatic instrumentation use ``patch_all``::

  from oteltrace import patch_all
  patch_all()

To toggle instrumentation for a particular module::

  from oteltrace import patch_all
  patch_all(redis=False, cassandra=False)

By default all supported libraries will be patched when
``patch_all`` is invoked.

**Note:** To ensure that the supported libraries are instrumented properly in
the application, they must be patched *prior* to being imported. So make sure
to call ``patch_all`` *before* importing libraries that are to be instrumented.

More information about ``patch_all`` is available in our :ref:`patch_all` API
documentation.


Manual Instrumentation
----------------------

If you would like to extend the functionality of the ``oteltrace`` library or gain
finer control over instrumenting your application, several techniques are
provided by the library.

Decorator
^^^^^^^^^

``oteltrace`` provides a decorator that can be used to trace a particular method
in your application::

  @tracer.wrap()
  def business_logic():
    """A method that would be of interest to trace."""
    # ...
    # ...

API details of the decorator can be found here :py:meth:`oteltrace.Tracer.wrap`.

Context Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To trace an arbitrary block of code, you can use the :py:mod:`oteltrace.Span`
context manager::

  # trace some interesting operation
  with tracer.trace('interesting.operations'):
    # do some interesting operation(s)
    # ...
    # ...

Further API details can be found here :py:meth:`oteltrace.Tracer`.

Using the API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the above methods are still not enough to satisfy your tracing needs, a
manual API is provided which will allow you to start and finish spans however
you may require::

  span = tracer.trace('operations.of.interest')

  # do some operation(s) of interest in between

  # NOTE: make sure to call span.finish() or the entire trace will not be sent
  # to OpenTelemetry
  span.finish()

API details of the decorator can be found here:

- :py:meth:`oteltrace.Tracer.trace`
- :py:meth:`oteltrace.Span.finish`.
